2. On your laptop, clone image_classification_app
   repo using Github Desktop.

   Git Large File Storage software from here:

4. cd to folder:
	D:\data\OneDrive\Documents\streamlit\image_classification_app

5. Issue command:

	git lfs install

6. Then issue command:

	git lfs track "*.h5"

7. Then, next, issue command:
	
	git add .gitattributes

8. Now copy your h5 file to this folder
   and Push it to orgin using GitHub Desktop
   as you normally do.
